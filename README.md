# bannerGen
Generate a cute banner

The ```generateBanner()``` function requires the following arguments: version (a string), uptime (a string), system (a string), and plugins (an integer). It will return the file path to the output image file, which is stored in the same directory as the script.

Please ensure that you have downloaded the "RobotoMono-Regular.ttf" font file, which can be obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono). Place the font file in the same directory as the script.
